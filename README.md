# Drewie by @WebGyver and @captFuture

This project is inspired by https://github.com/andywise/drawbot and several other wall hanging drawing robots like http://www.polargraph.co.uk or http://www.makelangelo.com/
The major drawback of all these beautiful machines for me was that you always need a PC to draw something or at least to convert files to Gcode.

The goal of the project is to create easily buildable hardware hardware components, use state of the art hardware and have a modern performing software on a reliable device.
